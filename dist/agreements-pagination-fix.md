# Agreements Table Pagination Fix

## Issue

The Agreements table had several issues when searching by dealership:

1. **Pagination not working properly**: When searching for a specific dealership and the result returned more than 100 records, the table was only showing the first 100 records without proper pagination.

2. **Dealer ID inconsistency**: There appeared to be a mismatch between the dealer ID selected in the UI and the one being used in the query.

3. **Search and filter interaction**: The local search was interfering with how total counts were calculated for pagination.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed pagination count handling**:
   - Changed how `effectiveTotalCount` is calculated to respect the total count from the database
   - Added detailed logging of pagination parameters
   - Ensured large result sets can be paginated through correctly

2. **Improved dealer filter consistency**:
   - Added explicit trimming and logging of dealer filter values
   - Ensured dealer filter is consistently applied across all queries

3. **Better query invalidation**:
   - Added query invalidation when filters change to ensure fresh data
   - Improved handling of filter changes to correctly reset to page 1

4. **Enhanced search behavior**:
   - Added query invalidation when clearing search term
   - Fixed interaction between search and pagination

## Expected Results

After these changes:

1. When searching for a dealership with many agreements (like "Service Activation Company" with 9,350 agreements), all pages should be properly accessible through pagination.

2. The total count displayed should be accurate, matching the actual number of agreements for the selected dealer.

3. Search functionality should work correctly on the current page of results without breaking pagination.

4. Dealer filtering should consistently use the correct dealer ID across all components.

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to the Agreements page
2. Search for "Service Activation Company" in the dealership search
3. Verify the total count shows "Displaying X of 9,350 agreements for Service Activation Company"
4. Confirm you can navigate to page 2, 3, etc.
5. Try using the search box and verify it filters the current page correctly
6. Clear the search and verify all agreements are shown again
