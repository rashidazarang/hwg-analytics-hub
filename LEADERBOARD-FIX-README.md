# Leaderboard Fix Documentation

This document explains the changes made to fix the leaderboard issues in the Claims Analytics Hub.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Leaderboard Timeout Errors**: The leaderboard was experiencing timeout errors due to inefficient SQL queries.
2. **Missing KPI Metrics**: KPI cards weren't showing expected revenue, funded revenue, and cancellation rates for top dealers.
3. **Top Dealers Table**: The top dealers table wasn't displaying all necessary fields.

## Solution

We've implemented the following changes:

1. **Optimized SQL Function**: Created a new SQL function `get_top_dealers_with_kpis` that efficiently fetches top 10 dealers with all required metrics.
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Updated the frontend to try the new function first, with fallback to the existing function if needed.
3. **Frontend Adaptations**: Modified the React components to work with either SQL function and display consistent data.
4. **KPI Calculations**: The KPI cards now display:
   - Total Expected Revenue (from pending contracts)
   - Total Funded Revenue (from active contracts)
   - Average Cancellation Rate (weighted by contract count)

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy the Frontend Changes

The frontend changes have been deployed and should already be working with existing SQL functions. However, you'll get better results by adding the new SQL function to the database.

### Step 2: Deploy the SQL Function

1. Set up your database connection environment variable:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/postgres
```

2. Run the deployment script:

```bash
bash deploy-leaderboard-fix.sh
```

This script will:
- Add the `get_top_dealers_with_kpis` function to the database
- Test the function with a simple query
- Report success or failure

### Alternative Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Connect to your database using a PostgreSQL client
2. Run the SQL in `supabase/migrations/add_detailed_top_dealers_function.sql`
3. Test with: `SELECT count(*) FROM get_top_dealers_with_kpis('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31');`

## Verification

After deployment, verify the leaderboard is working by:

1. Visiting the leaderboard page
2. Checking that the KPI cards show the three metrics
3. Verifying the top dealers table loads with all columns
4. Testing different date ranges

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the SQL function exists in the database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'get_top_dealers_with_kpis';
   ```
3. Test the function directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM get_top_dealers_with_kpis('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31') LIMIT 1;
   ```

If the function doesn't exist or returns errors, re-run the deployment script or check for SQL syntax errors.
